## Dataset

Itâ€™s a highly unbalanced dataset, one class is in significantly large portion than the other.
It has around 7000 rows with 96 predictors.

## EDA and Preprocessing

*There are no missing values in the entire dataset.
*All the columns  are numerical and scaled.
*To balance the dataset we have used various data balancing techniques.
*To deal with high dimensionality we have used PCA which reduced column count 96 to 11-14 while capturing 0.99 information.
*Data splitted into 70:30 ratio for training and validation set.

## Predictive Modeling 

We trained below models on Original Data, Undersampled Data, Oversampled Data, SMOTE sampled data and PCA dimension reduced data.
-Logistic Regression 
-Naive Bayes
-Random forest 
-Neural Network
